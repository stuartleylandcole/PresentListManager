Present List Manager is a useful program where you can store present ideas for friends and family.  

Present List Manager is incredibily configurable so you can store your ideas in a way that makes sense to you!  If you want categories for 'Christmas' and 'Anniversay' then you can create them.  You can have an unlimited number of lists within each category.  Your lists can consist of unlimited presents and each present idea can belong to multiple lists.  So if you want to buy the 'Frozen Planet' DVD for Dad for Christmas, you can might add it to a list called 'Dad' under the 'Christmas' category and to the 'Amazon' list under the 'Internet Shopping' category.

No-one wants a great present idea to be spoiled so to prevent someone from accidently viewing your ideas, you can add an individal password to each list.  This means you never need to fret about someone using your computer and seeing the wonderful present that you are going to buy them for Christmas.
